<h2>Industry Context: Historical Evolution and Current State</h2>
<p>Metal has been a cornerstone of architectural and structural innovation for over a century. From the pioneering use of iron in 19th-century industrial architecture to the ubiquitous use of steel in skyscrapers post-World War II, the metal design discipline has evolved hand in hand with engineering principles and manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>Today, the industry is characterized by a confluence of traditional metal materials like carbon steel and aluminum alongside advanced composites and alloys engineered for specific structural and environmental advantages. Digitally enabled design, including BIM and parametric workflows, has become standard, allowing intricate geometries and performance-driven forms. However, this progress sits against a backdrop of regulatory pressure to reduce embodied carbon and increase lifecycle sustainability.</p>
<p>Presently, metal design is transitioning from solely strength-centric approaches to a holistic integration of multi-performance criteria encompassing resilience, efficiency, environmental impact, and adaptability. The convergence of design-for-manufacture and design-for-disassembly marks a paradigm shift requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and sophisticated analytical tools.</p>
